# Pirozeda

This is the official repo of the Pirozeda project hosted on [hobbyelektronik.org](https://hobbyelektronik.org/w/index.php/Pirozeda).

This hard- and software enables you to capture and record data from a Prozeda heating controller with a Raspberry Pi.

Please note that both the server backend and frontend is more intended to ba a demonstrator and does not represent a proper software design.

Read more about it in the above linked documentation (German only).
